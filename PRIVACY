# LetiHome Privacy Policy

I take privacy seriously which means LetiHome does as well.
The permissions (on Android) needed to write and read storage or access network
information is purely for app functionality - be it performance, memory or user
facing information.

    No Data Collection: LetiHome doesn’t collect, track, or store any of your personal information.
    No Internet Stuff: The app doesn’t send anything anywhere. Everything stays on your device.
    No Third Parties: There are no ads, analytics, or hidden services.

That’s it! LetiHome is built to respect privacy, plain and simple.

If you have questions, feel free to reach out. Thanks for using LetiHome!
